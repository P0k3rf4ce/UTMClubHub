# UTMCLUBHUB Project Description
The University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) is home to a diverse range of clubs and
student organizations that form the backbone of campus life. However, with so many events and
activities happening simultaneously, it is impossible for students to stay informed and engaged.
To bridge this gap, we propose the development of a dedicated mobile application that serves
as a social media platform for UTM clubs, complete with a built-in event calendar.

**Problem**
    Most clubs have all their events advertised on various platforms such as instagram,
snapchat, discord, reddit etc. The main problem with this is these posts get lost through the high
volume of content on them. Once people pass a post, it is very unlikely for them to find it again.
Even then, students have to manually rsvp, and even figure out if they can even go to the club
with Office hours, lectures and tutorials. Overall, the whole club system is clunky and its very
demotivating for students to have to grind for hours to even find a club event.

**Solution**
    The solution is simple. Create a platform for clubs to post their events, and have a
calendar integrated into the app to show all the events going on in a certain day. Then students
can easily find the events, and RSVP for them all in one place. Additionally, having a built-in
calendar could allow students to import / upload their schedule and automatically see which
events they can attend. This will help students find new things to try on campus, and make it
easier for clubs to find new members.
